    "The [microgeo](https://github.com/ChaonanLi/microgeo) R package warps `ggplot2` and `ggspatial`, and other R packages involved in geographic information system (GIS) and machine learning such as `gstat`, `raster`, `terra`, `sf`, `sp` and `caret`. It permits the microbial biogeographical trait calculation, spatial data collection, and spatial interpolation, machine learning modeling/prediction and visualization for microbial biogeographical traits. Specifically, the [microgeo](https://github.com/ChaonanLi/microgeo) provides the flexible visualization methods for microbial traits onto maps, e.g., gridded-based visualization, spatial interpolation and machine learning, and it is not limited to those traits calculated by [microgeo](https://github.com/ChaonanLi/microgeo) package itself. Users can rapidly visualize any microbial traits calculated by other tools onto maps, and also can analyze microbiome dataset in conjunction with the data calculated by [microgeo](https://github.com/ChaonanLi/microgeo) R package. The [microgeo](https://github.com/ChaonanLi/microgeo) is currently undergoing continuous developments and updates. We welcome any ideas and suggestions. If you find any errors during use, please submit them to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ChaonanLi/microgeo/issues) or [Gitee Issues](https://gitee.com/bioape/microgeo/issues). \n",

    "Since several dependent R packages are not avaliable on `CRAN`, there are a few additional steps to use the [microgeo](https://github.com/ChaonanLi/microgeo) R package. Just run the following codes in your R console. Sometimes, when installing packages in RStudio, you may encounter situations where certain library files cannot be found. In such cases, you can simply switch to your terminal to perform the installation."
